# Project Name

## Purpose

This project provides a system for managing student records and generating personalized reports. The frontend collects user data and interacts with a backend service, which manages records and provides API endpoints for CRUD operations. The system also supports generating reports and processing data using AI.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** A React application that provides a user interface for data entry and interacts with the backend API.
- **Backend:** An Express-based Node.js application that handles API requests, manages JSON files for storing records, and provides endpoints for CRUD operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

# Installation and Running Instructions

## Install Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
    npm install

# Running the Project

To start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev

## Running the Application Locally

This command will start both the frontend and backend servers, allowing you to develop and test the application locally.

- **Frontend**: The React application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- **Backend**: The Express server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
